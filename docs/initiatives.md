# About

Open Science as a movement endeavours to make so-called [**research objects**](https://doi.org/10.1038/npre.2010.4626.1){target=_blank} accessible to all levels of society.

ICDI supports multiple initiatives in information technology and affiliated disciplines. Here we summarize our current initiatives and our resources which we make freely available to university faculty, staff, students, and the general public. 

[![scigov logo](assets/SciGov_logo.png){width=100} Open Data Announcements from federal agencies](https://open.science.gov/){target=_blank} require federally funded research projects publish and make openly available their data without embargo upon publication.

- [Open Data (Commons)](open-data.md) are cloud-based platforms with formal governance structures that allow communities to manage, analyze, and share their data.
