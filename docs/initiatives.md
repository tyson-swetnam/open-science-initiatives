# Open Science Initiatives

![Open Science Banner](assets/globe.jpeg)

Open Science as a movement endeavours to make so-called [**research objects**](https://doi.org/10.1038/npre.2010.4626.1){target=_blank} accessible to all levels of society.

ICDI supports multiple initiatives in information technology and affiliated disciplines. Here we summarize our current initiatives and our resources which we make freely available to university faculty, staff, students, and the general public.

- [Digital Twins](digital-twins.md) are integrated data-driven virtual representations of objects or systems designed to accurately reflect a physical objects or real-world systems. 

- [Open Data (Commons)](open-data.md) are cloud-based platforms with formal governance structures that allow communities to manage, analyze, and share their data.

- [Precision health and medicine](precision-health.md) includes genetic, environmental, and lifestyle information about patients which allow doctors to prescribe treatmetns and prevention strategies which are personalized to the individual.
