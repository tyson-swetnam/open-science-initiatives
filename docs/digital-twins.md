## About

The term 'Digital Twin' has existed since the early 1960's when it was first used to describe simulation models for the [Apollo space program](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210023699){target=_blank}. 

Digital twins should integrate real-time data from the physical counterpart to simulate, predict, and optimize performance in a virtual environment. Digital twins are common [in industrial applications](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2023.104007){target=_blank}, i.e., Industry 4.0 or Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), and in [civil engineering](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iintel.2023.100050){target=_blank}. An open source digital twin for IoT is [Eclipse Ditto](https://eclipse.dev/ditto/){target=_blank} and [iTwin.js](https://www.itwinjs.org/){target=_blank} for infrastructure.

In the last five years, mentions of [Digital Twins](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cirpj.2020.02.002){target=_blank} have [grown exponentially in the literature](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=digital+twin&sort=){target=_blank}. Semantically, terms like 'digital twin', 'simulation', 'prototype', or 'model' are used interchangeably in research applications. A digital twin is a virtual model that accurately represents a physical object, system, or process.
