## About

The term 'Digital Twin' has existed since at least the early 1960's when it was used to simulate models for the [Apollo space program](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210023699){target=_blank}. Semantic terms like 'simulation', 'prototype', or 'model' can be used interchangeably with 'digital twin'. 

Mentions of [Digital Twins](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cirpj.2020.02.002){target=_blank} have [grown exponentially in the literature](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=digital+twin&sort=){target=_blank} in the last five years.

## ICDI's support of Digital Twins

ICDI manages large computational and data storage resources in collaboration with [CyVerse.org](https://cyverse.org){target=_blank}. [Prof. Tyson Swetnam](https://datainsight.arizona.edu/person/tyson-swetnam){target=_blank}, ICDI's Director of Open Science Initiatives is a co-Principal Investigator of CyVerse and supports multiple extramural research awards focused on Digital Twin research.

If your research is using simulation, modelling, prototyping, or digital twins feel free to contact us to learn more about how we support research and education projects both locally and globally.
