!!! info "Guiding Principles"


    ??? Tip "**FAIR**"

        The **FAIR** principles aim to make data:

        - **Findable**: Data should be easy to locate for both humans and computers, with clear and rich metadata descriptions.
        - **Accessible**: Once found, data should be retrievable through open and standardized communication protocols.
        - **Interoperable**: Data should use shared standards and languages to enable integration with other datasets.
        - **Reusable**: Data should be well-documented and licensed in a way that permits reuse and repurposing.

    ??? Tip "**CARE**"

        The **CARE** principles focus on the governance of data relating to Indigenous Peoples:

        - **Collective Benefit**: Data ecosystems should be designed to deliver benefits for Indigenous communities.
        - **Authority to Control**: Indigenous Peoples have the right to govern the collection and use of their data.
        - **Responsibility**: Those working with Indigenous data have a duty to support Indigenous data governance.
        - **Ethics**: All data activities must be grounded in ethical practices that respect Indigenous rights.

    ??? Tip "**TRUST**"

        The **TRUST** principles provide guidance for trustworthy data repositories:

        - **Transparency**: Repositories should openly share information about their services and data holdings.
        - **Responsibility**: Clear accountability mechanisms should be in place for data stewardship.
        - **User Focus**: Services should meet the needs of the data community, including both providers and users.
        - **Sustainability**: Repositories should have sustainable funding and governance models.
        - **Technology**: Reliable and secure technical infrastructure is essential for data preservation and access.

    By adhering to the FAIR, CARE, and TRUST principles, our Open Data initiative ensures data remains a valuable, accessible, and ethical resource.
