Digital twins are common in industrial applications, i.e., Industry 4.0 or Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), and in civil engineering. An open source digital twin for IoT is Eclipse Ditto and iTwin.js for infrastructure.</p> <p>In the last five years, mentions of Digital Twins have grown exponentially in the literature. Semantically, terms like 'digital twin', 'simulation', 'prototype', or 'model' are used interchangeably in research applications. A digital twin is a virtual model that accurately represents a physical object, system, or process. </p>"},{"location":"digital-twins/#highlighting-icdi-support-of-digital-twins-research","title":"Highlighting ICDI support of Digital Twins research","text":"<p>Tyson Swetnam, ICDI's Director of Open Science Initiatives, is also a co-Principal Investigator of CyVerse.org which currently supports multiple awards on Digital Twins.</p>"},{"location":"digital-twins/#digital-twin-projects-university-of-arizona","title":"Digital Twin Projects @ University of Arizona","text":"<p>KMAP List of Faculty and Grants in Digital Twin Research </p> <p>School of Mining and Mineral Resources Virtual Reality </p> <p>School of Plant Sciences (CALES) </p>"},{"location":"digital-twins/#_1","title":"Digital Twins","text":""},{"location":"fellows/","title":"Join Us!","text":"<p>Are you already doing Open Science in your research or education programs?</p> <p>Let us know!</p> <p>We would love to feature your work and find out how we can better support you.</p> <p>Want to learn more about Open Science Initiatives at University of Arizona?</p> <p>Check out our: Initiatives Platforms Resources</p> Support Open Science at the University of Arizona <p>Join us in unlocking innovation through Open Science.</p> <p>By becoming a Supporter of Open Science, you will empower University of Arizona scientists and scholars to freely share their discoveries, accelerate breakthroughs, and find solutions to the world's most pressing challenges. </p> <p>Your tax-deductible charitable gift will help promote transparency, enhance educational opportunities, and ensures that knowledge is accessible to all. </p> <p>Together, we can drive progress and make a lasting impact on society.</p> <p>Contact Us</p>"},{"location":"fellows/#residency-fellowship-scholarship","title":"Residency, Fellowship, &amp; Scholarship","text":"<p>ICDI supports existing University of Arizona faculty, staff, and graduate students through fellowships and supplemental compensation.

It promotes the sharing of information, computational resources, data, software, and physical tools. As a movement Open Science endeavours to make so-called research objects accessible to all levels of society. As a philosophical foundation, Open Science connects advanced technologies to foster innovation and accelerate scientific data-driven discovery.</p> <p> Open Data Announcements from federal agencies require funded research projects to immediately publish and make openly available their data without embargo. </p> <p>Digital Twins Data Commons Precision Health Care</p> <p>Open Science in Context</p> <p>Here we summarize our current initiatives and our resources which we make freely available to university faculty, staff, students, and the general public. </p> <ul> <li> <p>Digital Twins: By applying Open Science principles to digital twins researchers can openly share their models and simulation results. Openness enables reproducibility via collective validation and iteration. The creation of digital twins across various fields, will enhance the accuracy of forecasting while also fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.</p> </li> <li> <p>Precision Health Care: Open Science plays a crucial role in advancing precision health care by promoting the open sharing of biomedical data, research findings, and analytical tools. By making genomic data, clinical trial results, and other health-related information accessible while ensuring patient privacy and ethical considerations, e.g., HIPAA privacy, researchers and clinicians can develop more personalized and effective treatments. This collaborative approach accelerates the understanding of individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle, which is essential for tailoring medical care to individual needs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Commons: Data commons are shared platforms where data, tools, and services are collectively managed and accessed. Under the Open Science framework, data commons become collaborative environments that encourage the sharing of large datasets and computational tools, supporting a culture of openness and mutual advancement.</p> </li> </ul> <p>By intertwining these elements within the Open Science paradigm, the scientific community can achieve greater efficiency, inclusivity, and impact. Open Science not only democratizes access to scientific knowledge and resources but also enhances the collective ability to address complex global challenges through shared innovation.</p>"},{"location":"open-data/","title":"Open Data","text":""},{"location":"open-data/#about","title":"About","text":"<p>Open Data refer to data that are freely available for anyone to access, use, modify, and share without restrictions.
